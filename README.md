# weatherapp
[Download](https://github.com/aamabile001/weatherapp/blob/main/AAWeatherApp.exe) my amazing weather app for Windows. Only works for Windows operating systems.

Check out the [code](https://github.com/aamabile001/weatherapp/blob/main/AAWeatherApp.py) for the program.

It's my first GUI Python application. It uses the open and free API from https://openweathermap.org/.
